Weekday adds `.weekday()` API to get or set locale aware day of the week.

```javascript
var weekday = require('dayjs/plugin/weekday')
dayjs.extend(weekday)

// when Sunday is the first day of the week
dayjs().weekday(-7); // last Sunday
dayjs().weekday(7); // next Sunday

// when Monday is the first day of the week
dayjs().weekday(-7) // last Monday
dayjs().weekday(7) // next Monday
```
